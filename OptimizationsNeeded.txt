index.js needs:
- Remove excess console logs from testing
- Add more comments to explain each function for the server
- Fix randomCode for "default" rooms to demo single player games

public/index.html needs:
- Update Title for Mobile input
- Transition to .ejs?

customize.js:
- to change animations
- to change name handling

Animations can be changed through "public/scripts/UI"

remove from project:
- 2dgame
- newgamehtml


Config -easier to edit
- Set Room based on URL?

fixes:
- mobile browser "enter/return & done"
- redirect


Syncing? (turn off for single device)

Tech Doc for what each login needed


Do we need to figure out a better way to create/sync with a court? Can new devices connect to an existing court, or should it always be a new court with a new device?

UI
- results screens




sarah somehow got into the game at the wrong time, and then started another game without telling the other players











Event sent every second from the server to the socket (counting clock down)

Server broadcasts every second

Server

Room - state machine

Court sends event - server changes states


If courts don't report


Rooms manage courts, master court manages player






server {
  courts {
    'MYCOURT' {
      players {
        'Sneaky Pirate' {

        }
      }
    },
    'HISCOURT' {
      players {
        ''
      }
    }
  }
}
